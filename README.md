Everything you need to know is in the projects discription.

I'm writing this on Linux Mint 13, and I have "libavutil-extra-51" as opposed to the default libavutil51.

The current version is a simpler version of what I was working on, the old one which will have many more features will be coming in an experimental branch when I get around to making one, the con with this one at the moment is that it makes quite large files, I will tweak and stuff, but for now I found my recording the whole desktop (click on your wallpaper) resulted in about a 50MB file per minute.. I shall keep up work on it.
